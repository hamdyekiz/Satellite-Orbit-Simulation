# Satellite-Orbit-Simulation
## System Model
In this project a software is written to simulate the space-systems. The space system described here includes a collection of satellites and ground stations. The schematic of this system is represented below:

![Representation of the System](https://github.com/hamdyekiz/SatelliteOrbitSimulation/blob/main/Project%20Documentations/Images/Picture21.png)

Two types of satellites are assumed to exist in this system: 
1)	Satellites that only receive data from the ground stations 
2)	Satellites that only send data to the ground stations
   
We have also three types of ground stations: 
1)	Ground stations that only communicate with the satellites 
2)	Ground stations that only track the satellites 
3)	Ground stations that both communicate with and track the satellites.

## Theories
You can access the more detailed explanation from here [Project Documentation](https://github.com/hamdyekiz/SatelliteOrbitSimulation/blob/main/Project%20Documentations/Project%20Documentation.pdf).

To simulate the motion of the satellite, numerical integration methods (Runge-Kutta 4th Order and Euler Integration) is used to solve the equations of motion. In figure below you can see the satellite and grand station representations:
